# Artificial Intelligence in Videogames Final Project

## Introduction

Game in Python using Pygame library.
Mario Bros game with AI implemented using dijkstra algorithm and state machine.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to have Python 3.x

We recommend using a virtual environment to install the project.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, you need to install the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!NOTE]\
> We use pygame library, it needs SDL2 library to be installed.

## Usage

To run the game, you need to execute the following command.

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

## Testing

To run the tests, you need to execute the following command.

```bash
# todo
```

## Documentation

The documentation of the game is available in `gdd` folder.

It contains the following information:
