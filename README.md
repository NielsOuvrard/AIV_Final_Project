# Artificial Intelligence in Videogames Final Project

## Introduction

Game in Python using Pygame library.
Mario Bros game with AI implemented using dijkstra algorithm and state machine.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to have Python 3.x

We recommend using a virtual environment to install the project.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, you need to install the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!NOTE]\
> We use pygame library, it needs SDL2 library to be installed.
> MacOS: `brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf`
> Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`
> Windows: Download and install the SDL2 development libraries from the [SDL2 website](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php). Make sure to follow the instructions for setting up the environment variables.

## Usage

To run the game, you need to execute the following command.

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

## Testing

To run the tests, you need to execute the following command.

```bash
# todo
```
